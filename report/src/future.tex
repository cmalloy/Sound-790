\begin{itemize}
\item Incorporate temporal masking by filtering the masking thresholds computed from the IR

\item Incorporate HRTFs in the calculation of directional excitation
% Incorporate bidirectional ray tracing instead of backwards ray tracing of the sound paths.

\item Try strategies to connect the paths and guide sampling on both ends to converge more efficiently

\item Improve sampling schemes based on the state-of-the-art multiple importance sampling algorithms from light transport

\item Binaural masking.

\item Use psychoacoustic metrics to mutate existing paths for manifold exploration

\item Go deeper into Rendering part of the system (how can we use psychoacoustic principles there)

\end{itemize}
