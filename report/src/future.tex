Evaluate the existing efficiency of the pipeline based on the distribution of paths in the existing renderer.
Conduct user study.

Decouple the propagation to include both backward and forward paths (carrying importance and source information respectively)
% Incorporate bidirectional ray tracing instead of backwards ray tracing of the sound paths.

Try strategies to connect the paths and guide sampling on both ends to converge more efficiently

Improve sampling schemes based on the state-of-the-art algorithms from graphics field.

Binaural masking.

Incorporate the support of temporal masking (forward, backward)

Go deeper into Rendering part of the system (how can we use psychoacoustic principles there)
