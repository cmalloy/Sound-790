We introduce a new method for optimizing the performance of path-based sound propagation phase of 3D audio simulation system by leveraging the perceptual feedback from the auralization (and rendering) stage. Our method combines using of psychoacoustics measures to prioritize perceptually important paths and guiding the ray tracing algorithm to better distribute rays to sources ...

% Exploit perceptual limitations of the human auditory system. Compression due to removal of perceptually irrelevant part of the signal. Results in inaudiable distortion.

% The human auditory system's inability to to hear quantization noise under condition of auditory masking.
